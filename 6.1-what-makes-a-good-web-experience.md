# 6.1 What makes a good web experience?



This is a group activity. As a group:

1. Discuss what you think makes for a good web experience. Draw on your own experiences and preferences.
2. Consider the different opinions of group members. Does it seem that things like age, culture, previous experience makes a difference?

1: There are many things of which make for a good web experience these things include consistent layout and headings like fonts. 

By having a look at other websites typically you will find a similar layout upon many different websites. 

Account/profile links which are expected to be found on the top right, footer on the button of the page, navigation bar containing links to other headers up the top of the page. 

typically if these items cannot be found in a respected place it can make for a bad user experience.

2: Age, culture and previous experience definitely make a difference. In regards to previous experience what i have wrote above is a good example of previous experience in relation to website UX. 

People of different age groups will have a different user experience. 

Older people may have poor eyesight so having big bold headers and uncluttered information will help to provide them with a good user experience, they may also not have as much "previous experience" so the typical layout of a website may not be known to them.

Website UX design in terms of culture

There are many cultural aspects you may need to watch out for an example of this would the use of the colour yellow.. in western countries this colour is typically associated with warmth, a summer feel and hospitality whilst in Latin America the colour is associated with death and mourning.
