# 5.2 Considering different technologies

1: Think of at least 4 different technologies where user interface design is an important consideration.

1.1: ATM's

1.2: Till/Cashier register

1.3: GPS

1.4: Mobile Phones 

2: Discuss in your course One Note Class Notebook why/how the user interface approach for each of these types of devices/technologies needs to differ.

2.1 ATM's need to be designed to be simple. As you are dealing with money it is important to have a good user interface. 

There needs to be a fail safe in place where if a button is pressed which is of importance it must pop up with confirmation of the action chosen. 

It is also very important to design atm's when withdrawing money the card comes out before the cash. It is a common case for people to leave behind their card.

2.2 A till system differs in many ways. in this case this is a restaurant till system it must record information of the tables occupied, if they have ordered food or not and a notification system which tells the user whether the tables have been sitting for sometime without ordering etc..

2.3 A GPS needs to be simple enough for a person to search the place they wish to go from their current location they should be able to choose different routes dependent on traffic.
