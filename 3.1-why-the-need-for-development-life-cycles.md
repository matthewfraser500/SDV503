# 3.1 Why the need for development life cycles?

**Systems Development Life Cycle**

There are 7 phases within the SDLC it is very important to follow these phases in order ranging from...

**1: Planning**

**2: Requirements**

**3: Design and Prototyping**

**4: Software Development**

**5: Testing**

**6:  Deployment**

**7: Operation and maintenance**

It ****is important to follow these steps in order so each phase is executed correctly avoid errors and giving the client the system they wanted which is planned out in phase 1 & 2. 

Otherwise we get to phase 6 and the system may not be what the client wanted which is wasting huge amount of resources and ruining reputation.
