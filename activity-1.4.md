# 1.4 IT Business Structure

**Book Store - Commerce**

An example of innovation within today's culture would be a bookstore owner who is well aware that in today society people no longer have the need for a physical store. 

In this case a good move would be for the business owner to move his store online either selling purely electronic books or take a different approach by creating an eCommerce site which sells books instead of having to maintain a store. ****

This saves the business owner money for rent and employment costs.

If the business owner likes to increase his profit margin he may also like to speak with local school and university offering bulk deals in exchange for partnership.
